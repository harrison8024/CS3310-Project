Description:
	This program is a calculator where you can solve the knapsack problem.
	Knapsack problem wants to solve the problem with a limited capacity, 
	but to maximize the profit within the given limitation.
	
	Two different method:
		1. Fractional Knapsack - each item can be separated into fractions to put in the sack.
		
		2. 0/1 Knapsack - each item can not be separated, so you either put in the sack or leave it.
		
How to:
	1. This program will ask the user for the capacity of the knapsack.
	
	2. The user can decide to input the data, or use the default data set.
	
	3. After the data is inputed, the user can choose which method to use to solve the problem.
	
	4. Finally, it will output the result for the total/maximum profit of the problem.
