By Harrison Chen

-How to run the code:

	-There are three methods in the source code that can run each task:

		1. task1(): This method will run both merge sort and quick sort, and
record it's time for different size of array n.

		2. task2(): This method will run the Hanoi tower problem, and record it's time for different number of disk.

		3. task3(): This method will run both the classical matrix multiplication, and the Strassen's matrix multiplication, and record it's time for different size of matrix n.
